#Overview
This project is an implementation of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) using Python. The goal is to demonstrate how to code and visualize the efficient frontier in MPT, which is a graphical representation of the trade-off between risk and return for a set of portfolios.

#Requirements
The following Python packages are required to run the code in this project:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
SciPy
yFinance
Usage
The project contains a single script, mpt.py, which can be run from the command line. The script uses sample data from several publicly traded companies to calculate and plot the efficient frontier.

To run the script, navigate to the project directory in the command line and enter the following command:

Copy code
python mpt.py
This will execute the script and display the efficient frontier plot.

#Customization
The script can be easily customized to use different data and parameters. The sample data used in the script can be replaced with data for any set of publicly traded companies. Additionally, the script can be modified to include more or fewer assets in the portfolio, and to change the optimization method used to calculate the efficient frontier.

#Conclusion
This project provides a working example of how to code and visualize the efficient frontier in MPT using Python. The provided script can be used as a starting point for further analysis and customizations.
